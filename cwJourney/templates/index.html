    <h1>My Learning Journey</h1>
    <p>
        My learning journey began in pre-primary where I learned basic skills and how to be part of a class.
        Through primary and secondary school I studied many subjects, joined activities, and discovered my interests.
        In college I learned independence, time management and teamwork. These experiences shaped my growth and love for learning.
